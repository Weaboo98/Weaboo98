- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Weaboo98
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested most in Python but also SQL, C++, C#, Java and Javascript. I have a lot of experience in work related to Sql and the Python libraries Tkinter and Wxpython.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and C# at my uni and on my own the Pandas library in Python.
- Most of my work experience is related to Python, UI development with SQL capabilities. 
- On my own i wrote a code for cash registers, with Tkinter UI, SQLite database, and periferial capabilities for receipt printers.
- While working for Nokia Solutions I made a WxPython UI with for monitoring radio tower datatraffic specifically for railways.
- Unfortunately I can't publish these codes, I don't have access to them anymore.
